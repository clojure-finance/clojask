# Clojask
> Clojure data processing framework with parallel computing on larger-than-memory datasets

### Features

- **Unlimited Size**

  It supports datasets larger than memory.

- **Various Operations**

  Although Clojask is designed for larger-than-memory datasets, like NoSQLs, it does not sacrifice common operations on relational dataframes, such as [group by](https://clojure-finance.github.io/clojask-website/posts-output/API/#group-by), [aggregate](https://clojure-finance.github.io/clojask-website/posts-output/API/#aggregate), [join](https://clojure-finance.github.io/clojask-website/posts-output/API/#inner-join--left-join--right-join).

- **Fast**

  Faster than Dask in most operations, and the larger the dataframe is, the bigger the advantage. Please find the benchmarks [here](https://clojure-finance.github.io/clojask-website/pages-output/about/#benchmarks).

- **All Native Types**

  All the datatypes used to store data are native Clojure (or Java) types.

- **From File to File**

  Integrate IO inside the dataframe. No need to write your own read-in and output functions.

- **Parallel**

  Most operations could be executed into multiple threads or even machines. See the principle in [Onyx](http://www.onyxplatform.org/).

- **Lazy Operations**

  Most operations will not be executed immediately. Dataframe will intelligently pipeline the operations altogether in computation.

- **Little Constraints on programming**

  Except for some aggregations where you need to write customized functions subject to simple templates, operations in Clojask support arbitrary Clojure functions as input

### Example Usage

1. Import `Clojask`

   ```clojure
   (require '[clojask.dataframe :as ck])
   ```

2. Initialize a dataframe

   ```clojure
   (def df (ck/dataframe "Employees-example.csv"))
   ```

   The source file can be found [here](https://github.com/clojure-finance/clojask/blob/1.x.x/test/clojask/Employees-example.csv).

   See [`dataframe`](https://clojure-finance.github.io/clojask-website/posts-output/API/#dataframe)

3. Preview the first few lines of the dataframe

   ```clojure
   (ck/print-df df)
   ```

   See [`print-df`](https://clojure-finance.github.io/clojask-website/posts-output/API/#print-df)

4. Change the data type of some columns

   ```clojure
   (ck/set-type df "Salary" "double")
   (ck/set-type df "UpdateDate" "date:yyyy/MM/dd")
   (ck/print-df df)
   ```

   ![image-20220405210826777](docs/img/image-20220405210826777.png)

   See [`set-type`](https://clojure-finance.github.io/clojask-website/posts-output/API/#set-type)

5. Add 100 to Bob as `NewSalary`

   ```clojure
   (ck/operate df (fn [EmployeeName Salary] (if (= EmployeeName "Bob") (+ Salary 100) Salary)) ["EmployeeName" "Salary"] "NewSalary")
   (ck/print-df df)
   ```

   ![image-20220405211348723](docs/img/image-20220405211348723.png)

   See [`operate`](https://clojure-finance.github.io/clojask-website/posts-output/API/#operate-in-place-modification)

6. Output the resultant dataset to "result.csv" (Use 8 threads)

   ```clojure
   (ck/compute df 8 "result.csv" :select ["Employee" "EmployeeName" "Department" "NewSalary" "UpdateDate"])
   ```

   See [`compute`](https://clojure-finance.github.io/clojask-website/posts-output/API/#compute)
